## Introduction

This specific game was originally published in a Java web, by Paul Scott. The player will be given a grid of 16 squares, six of which are blue spotted randomly; on one square rests a cube.

### How to Play

- Using the mouse or arrow keys, roll the cube onto a blue square, then the blue square will be picked up on one face of the cube.
- If the player rolls a blue face of the cube onto a non-blue square, the blueness puts down again.

### Role

The Player's role is to use the mouse or arrow keys to roll the cube through 90 degrees so that player can fill the whole side of the cube with a blue square placed on the floor.

### Cube Controls

This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse.

- Left-clicking anywhere on the window will move the cube towards the mouse pointer.
- The arrow keys can also used to roll the cube on its square grid in the four cardinal directions.
- The four keys surrounding the arrow keys on the numeric keypad (7,9,1,3) can be used for diagonal movement.
