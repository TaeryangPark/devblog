## Introduction

This specific game was originally published in a Java web, by Paul Scott. You will be given a grid of 16 squares, six of which are blue; on one square rests a cube.

### How to Play

- Using mouse or arrow keys, roll the cube on to a blue square, then the blue square will be picked up on one face of the cube.
- If you roll a blue face of the cube on to a non-blue square,the blueness is put down again.

### Role

Your role is to use the mouse key to roll the cube through 90 degrees so that you can fill the whole side of cube with blue square which is placed on the floors.
