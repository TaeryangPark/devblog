## Introduction

This specific game was originally published in a Java web, by Paul Scott. The player will be given a grid of 16 squares, six of which are blue; on one square rests a cube.

### How to Play

- Using the mouse or arrow keys, roll the cube onto a blue square, then the blue square will be picked up on one face of the cube.
- If the player rolls a blue face of the cube onto a non-blue square, the blueness puts down again.

### Role

Your role is to use the mouse key to roll the cube through 90 degrees so that you can fill the whole side of the cube with a blue square placed on the floor.
